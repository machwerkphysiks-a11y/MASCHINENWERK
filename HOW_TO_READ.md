# How to Read This Repository

This repository is not a linear text.

Files are independent formal definitions.
No narrative order is assumed.

Recommended reading order:

1. U-space (relational reference space)
2. Projection and mapping definitions
3. Injectivity and inverse mapping
4. Validity domains (m₂)
5. Boundary concepts (Schwarzgrenze, Δ₀)
6. Consistency axioms (CRA)

No file relies on metaphor, analogy, or interpretation.

If a definition appears abstract, this is intentional.
Interpretation is handled exclusively in the book.
