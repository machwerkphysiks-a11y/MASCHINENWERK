\section{Delta Zero $\Delta_0$}

$\Delta_0$ denotes a formal boundary marker for non-reconstructible residues
arising from projection beyond injective domains.

It does not represent a value, state, or limit.
It marks the absence of recoverable relational structure.

Formally, $\Delta_0$ characterizes expressions for which
no unique inverse projection exists:
\[
\not\exists\, \Pi^{-1}.
\]

$\Delta_0$ is not an infinitesimal and not a physical zero.
It indicates loss of relational determinacy.

Calculations producing $\Delta_0$ remain formally valid,
but cannot be assigned physical meaning within the model.

$\Delta_0$ therefore separates
\begin{itemize}
    \item undefined reconstruction
    \item from undefined dynamics.
\end{itemize}

It functions as a consistency marker preventing
implicit re-interpretation of non-recoverable expressions.
