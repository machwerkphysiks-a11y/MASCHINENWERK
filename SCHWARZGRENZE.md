# Black Boundary (Σ)

The black boundary does **not** denote a physical location.
It is not a singularity, not an event horizon, and not a geometric surface.

The black boundary is a **structural marker of describability**.

It marks the point at which physical interpretation loses uniqueness,
even though formal consistency is preserved.

## Formal Definition

Let

\[
\Pi : \mathcal{U} \rightarrow \mathcal{M}
\]

be a projection from the relational full space \(\mathcal{U}\)
into an observable calculation space \(\mathcal{M}\).

The **black boundary** \(\Sigma\) is defined as the set of relational states
for which the projection loses injectivity:

\[
\Sigma := \{\, u \in \mathcal{U} \mid \Pi \text{ is not injective at } u \,\}
\]

At the black boundary, distinct relational configurations
become observationally indistinguishable.

## Meaning of the Boundary

Beyond the black boundary:

- relational structures remain consistent  
- formal continuation remains possible  
- mathematical description does not collapse  

What is lost is **backprojectability**, not existence.

Multiple distinct relational states
map to the same observable representation.

The observable physics remains formally stable,
but its interpretation ceases to be unique.

---

## What the Black Boundary Is Not

The black boundary is:

- not a physical object  
- not an ontological claim  
- not a boundary of the U-space  
- not a singular region of spacetime  

It introduces no new entities
and asserts no new dynamics.

It is exclusively a **boundary of observability**.

---

## Observational Consequences

At or beyond the black boundary:

- measurements remain well-defined  
- equations may remain solvable  
- predictions may remain numerically stable  

However:

- causal reconstruction fails  
- state identification becomes ambiguous  
- physical interpretation becomes non-unique  

This ambiguity is not epistemic.
It is structural.

## Relation to Known Boundary Phenomena

Several well-known physical limit regimes
can be classified as **manifestations of black boundaries**, including:

- Planck-scale regimes  
- event horizons  
- phase transitions  
- singularity-adjacent descriptions  

The black boundary does **not** replace these descriptions.

It provides a **formal unifying criterion**
that explains why interpretation fails
across otherwise unrelated physical contexts.

---

## Role Within the Framework

The black boundary separates:

- physically backprojectable statements  
from  
- formally admissible but non-uniquely interpretable continuations  

It functions as a **filter**, not a prohibition.

Formal extension is always permitted.
Physical interpretation is conditionally restricted.

Everything beyond the boundary depends solely
on the structure of the projection,
not on additional assumptions, hypotheses, or ontologies.

---

## Structural Status

The black boundary is a property of mappings, not of systems.

It is neither discovered nor postulated.
It follows necessarily from the structure of projection itself.

Wherever projection loses injectivity,
a black boundary exists.
