## Index (Concept Anchors)

This index lists the central concepts of the work **MACHWERK**.
It serves as an orientation aid, a machine-readable reference, and a structured
entry point into the conceptual space of the framework.

The index does not define concepts.
It anchors terminology used consistently throughout the work and the repository.

### Notes

All listed terms are used in a **strictly formal sense**.

No term implies:
- an ontological claim,
- an interpretation of quantum mechanics,
- or an empirical hypothesis.

The index is extensible.
New terms are added only when they are structurally required by the framework.
