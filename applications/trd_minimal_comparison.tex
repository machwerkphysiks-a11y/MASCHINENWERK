\section{Minimal TRD Comparison}

Let three distinguishable process rates be given:
\[
R_1,\; R_2,\; R_3
\]

Define relational ratios:
\[
X_{12} = \frac{R_1}{R_2}, \quad
X_{23} = \frac{R_2}{R_3}, \quad
X_{31} = \frac{R_3}{R_1}
\]

These ratios satisfy:
\[
X_{12} \cdot X_{23} \cdot X_{31} = 1
\]

\subsection*{Admissibility}

The comparison is admissible because:
\begin{itemize}
    \item at least three relational quantities are involved,
    \item all quantities are ratios of process rates,
    \item the statement is invariant under global rescaling.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{CRA Check}

Let
\[
\mathcal{R} = \{X_{12}, X_{23}, X_{31}\}
\]

If
\[
\forall X_{ij} \in \mathcal{R}:\quad X_{ij} \in m_2
\]
then the statement is physically admissible.

No absolute rate appears.
No external reference is required.
