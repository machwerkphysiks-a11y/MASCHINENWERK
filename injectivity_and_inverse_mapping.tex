\section{Injectivity and Inverse Mapping}

A projection $\Pi$ is injective on a domain $D \subseteq \mathcal{U}$
if and only if

\[
\forall u_1, u_2 \in D :
\Pi(u_1) = \Pi(u_2) \Rightarrow u_1 = u_2
\]

Injectivity guarantees distinguishability of relational states
after projection.

If $\Pi$ is injective on $D$,
a unique inverse mapping exists:

\[
\Pi^{-1} : \Pi(D) \rightarrow D
\]

If injectivity fails,
$\Pi^{-1}$ is not well-defined.

Loss of injectivity does not invalidate formal computation,
but destroys physical reconstructability.

Injectivity is therefore a local property of projection,
not a global property of the relational space.
