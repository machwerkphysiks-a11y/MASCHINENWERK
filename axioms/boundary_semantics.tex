\section{Boundary Semantics}

Crossing a projection boundary does not invalidate
a computation.

Let $r \in \mathcal{U}$ be a relational configuration
such that
\[
r \notin m_2
\]
due to loss of injectivity of $\Pi$.

Then the expression involving $r$ remains:
\begin{itemize}
    \item mathematically well-formed,
    \item logically consistent,
    \item physically non-interpretable.
\end{itemize}

The Schwarzgrenze $\Sigma$ therefore marks
not a breakdown of formal reasoning,
but a transition in semantic status.

Physical meaning is restricted to $m_2$.
Formal continuation beyond $\Sigma$
is permitted but explicitly marked
as non-physical.

This distinction is structural and non-negotiable.
