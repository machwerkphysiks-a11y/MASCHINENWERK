\section{Projection}

A projection is a mapping
\[
\Pi : \mathcal{U} \rightarrow m
\]
from the relational reference space $\mathcal{U}$ into a calculable space $m$.

The projection $\Pi$ is, in general,
\begin{itemize}
    \item information reducing,
    \item context dependent,
    \item not necessarily injective.
\end{itemize}

No physical interpretation is assigned to $\mathcal{U}$ itself.
Physical meaning arises only after projection into a domain
where relational expressions are evaluable.

The structure of $m$ is fully determined by the properties of $\Pi$.
