\section{Injectivity}

A projection
\[
\Pi : \mathcal{U} \rightarrow m
\]
is injective on a subset $D \subseteq \mathcal{U}$ if and only if
\[
\forall u_1, u_2 \in D:\quad
\Pi(u_1) = \Pi(u_2) \Rightarrow u_1 = u_2.
\]

Injectivity is not a global property of $\Pi$,
but a domain-dependent condition.

Only within injective regions of the projection
is a unique relational reconstruction possible.

Loss of injectivity does not invalidate formal computation,
but eliminates the possibility of unambiguous physical interpretation.
