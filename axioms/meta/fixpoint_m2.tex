\section{Fixpoint Definition of $m_2$}

The domain $m_2$ is not postulated as a static set.
It is defined recursively as a fixpoint
of relational applicability.

Let $\mathcal{F}$ be an operator acting on
sets of relational expressions such that
\[
\mathcal{F}(X)
\]
contains exactly those relations that remain
uniquely backprojectable under all admissible
relational operations.

Then $m_2$ is defined as the maximal fixpoint:
\[
m_2 := \mathrm{Fix}(\mathcal{F})
\]

A relational state belongs to $m_2$
if and only if it remains within $m_2$
under the application of all admissible relations.

If a relation leaves this fixpoint,
the computation remains formally valid
but loses physical interpretability.
