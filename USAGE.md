# Intended Use

This repository provides the formal core of the MACHWERK framework.

It is intended to be used as:

- a machine-readable specification of formal admissibility conditions,
- a reference framework for symbolic reasoning and model comparison,
- a consistency layer for evaluating physical statements at their validity limits.

This repository is **not** intended to be:

- executed as software,
- used for numerical simulation,
- applied as a computational physics toolkit.

No numerical input–output behavior is defined here.

Reasoning within this repository proceeds exclusively via
formal structure, relational consistency, and domain stability.
