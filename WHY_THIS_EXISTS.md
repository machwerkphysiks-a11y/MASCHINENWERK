# Why This Repository Exists

Modern theoretical physics often mixes:

- formal continuation,
- physical interpretation,
- and speculative extension.

This repository separates these layers.

Its sole purpose is to make explicit:

- where physical statements are admissible,
- where models lose unique reference,
- and where formal continuation must not be mistaken for physics.

This is a structural framework, not a theory.

It does not compete with existing physics.
It constrains how physics is allowed to speak.
