# MACHWERK  
## Formal Conditions of Physical Admissibility

**MACHWERK** is a formally closed, axiomatic framework for theoretical physics.

Despite the historical repository naming, this project is **not related to accessibility tooling**.
It defines the **formal conditions under which physical statements, equations, and models
are admissible, comparable, and meaningfully interpretable**.

This GitHub repository contains the **formal mathematical core** of MACHWERK.

The framework is fully developed and published as a printed monograph:

**MACHWERK — Formale Bedingungen physikalischer Beschreibbarkeit**  
Author: Stefan Schwarz  
ISBN: 979-8-24410-846-0  
(https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18478523)
Platform: Amazon (Print-on-Demand)  
Release date: February 1, 2026  

This repository does **not** replace the book.  
It provides the **machine-readable, axiomatic kernel** on which the book is based.

## What MACHWERK Is

MACHWERK is a **formal meta-framework for physics**.

It does not propose new dynamics.  
It defines the **formal preconditions** under which *any* physical theory
can be stated without internal contradiction or category error.

Formally, MACHWERK specifies:

- relational state spaces
- projection operators into observable domains
- domains of validity for physical statements
- structural boundary markers (loss of injectivity)
- admissibility criteria governed by consistency axioms

MACHWERK introduces **no particles, forces, fields, constants, or speculative entities**.

Instead, it addresses a logically prior question:

> **Under which formal conditions is a physical statement well-defined at all?**

Only once these conditions are fixed does conventional physics
(classical, relativistic, quantum, or cosmological)
become meaningfully interpretable.

---

## What MACHWERK Is Not

MACHWERK is explicitly:

- **not** a competing physical theory  
- **not** an interpretation of quantum mechanics  
- **not** a numerical simulation framework  
- **not** speculative or metaphysical philosophy  

No experimental claims are asserted here.  
No ontological commitments are imposed.

All established physical theories remain **fully valid within their respective
domains of applicability**.

MACHWERK does not replace physics.  
It clarifies **where physics is allowed to speak at all**.

## Why This Repository Exists

The printed book contains:

- conceptual motivation
- full formal development
- derivations
- structured applications (Parts A–E)
- boundary analyses across multiple physics domains

This repository contains **only the formal kernel**, intentionally stripped of:

- prose
- interpretation
- examples
- didactic explanation

The purpose of this repository is to make the framework:

- **machine-readable**
- **algorithmically inspectable**
- **formally auditable**
- **usable for derivation, validation, and consistency checks**

This separation is deliberate and methodologically essential.

## Calculability and Formal Use

MACHWERK is **not descriptive**.  
It is **operational**.

The formal core defines:

- operators
- mappings
- relational domains
- fixpoint criteria
- admissibility constraints

These structures **can be used for calculation, derivation, and formal validation**
of physical models.

What MACHWERK restricts is **not computation**,  
but **uncontrolled interpretation**.

If a statement cannot be uniquely related back through the defined projections,
it is **formally inadmissible as a physical statement** —
even if it remains mathematically well-defined.

This rule is **structural**, not interpretive.

---

## Core Concepts (Formal Kernel)

The formal kernel is organized bottom-up:

1. **Relational Full Space (U-Space)**  
   A non-geometric, non-temporal relational reference domain.

2. **Projection (Π)**  
   Mappings from relational configurations into observable calculation spaces.

3. **Injectivity and Invertibility**  
   Conditions under which projections preserve distinguishability.

4. **Validity Domains (m₂)**  
   Domains in which physical statements remain uniquely interpretable.

5. **Boundary Markers (Σ, Δ₀)**  
   Formal markers for loss of injectivity and non-recoverable residues.

6. **Fixpoint Criteria**  
   Recursive stability conditions for admissible statements.

7. **CRA Axiom (Consistency of Relational Applicability)**  
   A global consistency constraint governing admissibility.

Each concept is defined in a **single, self-contained formal file**.

## Repository Structure

This repository is intentionally **non-linear**.

Each file defines exactly one formal concept.  
No file assumes definitions that appear later.

Recommended reading order:

- `u_space.tex`
- `projection_definition.tex`
- `projection_operator.tex`
- `injectivity_and_invertibility.tex`
- `m2_definition.tex`
- `black_boundary_sigma.tex`
- `delta_zero.tex`
- `fixpoint_m2.tex`
- `cra_axiom.tex`

## Relation to the Book

The book applies this formal kernel to:

- dimensional emergence
- limits of spacetime descriptions
- quantum correlations
- gravitational boundaries
- cosmological edge cases
- relational process dynamics (TRD)

These applications are **deliberately not duplicated here**.

This repository provides the **formal ground truth**
against which those analyses can be reconstructed,
verified, or rederived.

## Intended Audience

This repository is intended for:

- theoretical physicists
- mathematicians
- logicians
- computer scientists
- AI researchers working with formal reasoning systems

It assumes familiarity with:

- formal logic
- abstract mathematical structures
- non-narrative specification styles

This is **not** a tutorial repository.
