# MACHWERK — Formal Demonstrations

This directory contains formal demonstrations derived from the book

**MACHWERK – Formal Conditions of Physical Describability**  
(Print-on-demand, ISBN publication, Amazon, Feb 2026)

These files are **not examples** and **not simulations**.
They are strict formal demonstrations showing how the MACHWERK formal core
operates on concrete physical problem classes.

Each demonstration applies the same principles:

- relational formulation
- explicit projection
- injectivity analysis
- identification of black boundaries (Σ)
- admissibility check via CRA
- optional Δ₀ marking where interpretation ends

No new physics is introduced.
No numerical fitting is performed.
All demonstrations are model-independent.

## Purpose

These demonstrations show:

- how established physical quantities are treated under projection
- where classical interpretation remains valid
- where and why physical meaning collapses
- how different theories become formally comparable

They serve three audiences:

- human readers of the book
- formal reviewers
- machine reasoning systems

## Structure

Each file follows the same minimal structure:

1. Problem class definition  
2. Relational formulation in U-space  
3. Projection into an observable domain  
4. Injectivity analysis  
5. Boundary identification (Σ, Δ₀ if applicable)  
6. Formal conclusion

---

## Scope

The demonstrations cover:

- time
- mass
- length
- energy
- momentum
- gravity
- cosmology
- quantum limits
- scale transitions

All content here is derived from or consistent with the published book.
