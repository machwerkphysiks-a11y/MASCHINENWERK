\section{Time}

Time is not a primitive parameter.

Within MACHWERK, time is a
\textbf{derived ordering relation}
between process rates.

\subsection{Formal Role}

Time emerges from the comparison of relational changes
within a stable projection domain.

There is no global time variable in $\mathcal{U}$.

\subsection{Local Validity}

Temporal ordering exists only where:
\begin{itemize}
\item projection is injective
\item relational change is uniquely comparable
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Boundary Behavior}

At Schwarzgrenzen:
\begin{itemize}
\item temporal ordering becomes ambiguous
\item continuation remains formal only
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Non-Assumptions}

Time is not:
\begin{itemize}
\item universal
\item continuous by necessity
\item globally ordered
\end{itemize}
