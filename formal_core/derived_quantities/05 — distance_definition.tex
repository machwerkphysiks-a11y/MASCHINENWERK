\section{Distance}

Distance is not a fundamental quantity.

There is no distance in the U-space.

\subsection{Emergence}

Distance emerges only within projected calculation spaces
as an ordering measure between relational configurations.

\subsection{Projection Dependence}

Distance depends entirely on:
\begin{itemize}
\item the projection $\Pi$
\item the chosen representation space
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Boundary Behavior}

At non-injective projection regions,
distinct relational states may map to identical distances.

Distance remains writable but non-interpretable.
