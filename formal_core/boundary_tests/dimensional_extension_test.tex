\section{Dimensional Extension Boundary Test}

This test examines claims of additional dimensions
under projection constraints.

\subsection{Setup}

Let
\[
\Pi : \mathcal{U} \rightarrow \mathcal{M}
\]
be a projection into a finite observable space.

\subsection{Claim}

Assume an extension
\[
\mathcal{M}' = \mathcal{M} \times D
\]
without modifying $\Pi$.

\subsection{Projection Analysis}

No inverse mapping
\[
\Pi^{-1} : \mathcal{M}' \rightarrow \mathcal{U}
\]
exists for the extended space.

\subsection{Boundary Condition}

Dimensional extensions without projective origin
reside entirely beyond the black boundary.

\subsection{Admissibility}

Such extensions are formally definable
but physically inadmissible.

\subsection{Conclusion}

Dimensions are properties of projections,
not independent physical entities.
