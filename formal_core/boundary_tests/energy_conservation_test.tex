\section{Energy Conservation Boundary Test}

This test evaluates energy conservation
under non-injective projection.

\subsection{Setup}

Let
\[
\Pi : \mathcal{U} \rightarrow m_2
\]
be a projection into an observable energy-description space.

\subsection{Injective Regime}

If projection is injective,
energy conservation can be reconstructed
as a relational invariant.

\subsection{Boundary Regime}

At the black boundary,
multiple relational configurations
map to identical observable energy states.

\subsection{Formal Validity}

Energy conservation equations
remain mathematically consistent.

\subsection{Physical Admissibility}

Energy attribution to internal processes
is no longer uniquely definable.

Only projected energy balances
remain physically admissible.

\subsection{Conclusion}

Energy conservation survives formally,
but loses explanatory depth
beyond the injective regime.
