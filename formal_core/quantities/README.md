# Physical Quantities and Derived Formulas

This directory defines how physical quantities arise
within the MACHWERK framework.

No quantity is treated as fundamental.
All quantities are derived from relational structures
and projection constraints.

This section provides the formal bridge
between the axiomatic core and calculable physics.

Scope:

- no new physical constants
- no empirical fitting
- no numerical simulation
- no ontological assumptions

All quantities are defined as:

- ratios
- densities
- projection effects
- consistency constraints

This corresponds to the chapter
"Physikalische Größen und Umrechnungen"
in the book MACHWERK.

The purpose of this section is:

- to show how standard physical quantities emerge
- to allow comparison with established formulas
- to make the framework computationally usable

Reading order is sequential.
