# MACHWERK — Overview

MACHWERK is a formal framework for theoretical physics.

It does not propose a new competing physical theory and does not replace
or modify established physical laws.
Instead, it defines the **formal conditions under which physical statements
are meaningful, admissible, and comparable**.

The framework operates one level above concrete theories.

## Core Focus

MACHWERK is concerned with:

- relational description instead of object-based assumptions  
- projection instead of direct ontological access  
- backprojectability as the criterion for physical meaning  
- explicit treatment of structural boundary regions (“black boundaries”)  
- formal separation between describable physics and non-invertible extensions  

The framework does not introduce new dynamics.
It clarifies **when existing dynamics can be meaningfully applied**.

## What This Is About

MACHWERK investigates:

- when physical statements are well-defined  
- where theoretical models lose physical validity  
- how different physical approaches become formally comparable  
- how boundary artifacts arise from projection, not from nature  

Rather than asking *what exists*, MACHWERK asks:

**Under which formal conditions can a physical statement be justified?**

## Central Concepts

Key structural elements include:

- **U-space**  
  A fully relational ordering domain without space, time, metric, or geometry.

- **Projection and Injectivity**  
  Observable structure arises through projection from relational domains.
  Physical meaning depends on injective mappings.

- **m₂ / m₃ Domains**  
  Levels of physical describability and formal continuation.
  m₂ supports backprojectable physics.
  m₃ allows formal extension without physical interpretation.

- **Black Boundaries (Σ)**  
  Structural limits where injectivity is lost.
  These are limits of description, not of reality.

- **Three-Reaction Dynamics (TRD)**  
  A minimal relational comparison structure.
  It serves as a formal kernel for evaluating relational consistency.

---

## What This Is Not

MACHWERK explicitly does **not** provide:

- a “theory of everything”  
- additional spatial or temporal dimensions  
- speculative ontology  
- physical claims without backprojectability  

All established physical theories remain fully valid **within their respective
domains of applicability**.

MACHWERK does not challenge results.
It challenges **category errors**.

## Repository Status

This repository serves as a **public reference point**.

The complete work exists independently (ISBN publication).
Only formal structures, definitions, and reference material are maintained here.

Content in this repository may be reorganized, reduced, or updated
without altering the formal core of the framework.

## Classification

- theoretical physics  
- formal physics  
- foundations / meta-theory  
- philosophy of physics (methodological, non-metaphysical)

## Summary

MACHWERK does not tell physics what to calculate.

It tells physics **when a calculation still means something**.
